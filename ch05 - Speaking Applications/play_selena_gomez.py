For copyright reasons, put your own songs in /mpt/ch05/chat/

Make sure you have the pygame module installed in your virtual environment
Since software is constantly being updated, the installation instructions are likely to change.
I suggest you refer to the Pygame official website
https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted/
for instructions if you get stuck. 

If pygame doesn't work, use vlc or playsound or pydub to play
e.g., the script pay_selena_gomez_vlc.py uses vlc
